In 2020 due to the global pandemic caused by Covid-19 there was an increase in almost 320 million that lacked access to adequate food; nearly one in three people in the world 
(2.37 billion) did not have access to adequate food in 2020. Covid-19 showcased many of the weaknesses of the global supply chain and plunged many people into compromising situations
of uncertain food security. 

China supplies over 20% of the world population with food and India is the largest agricultural producer accounting for 25% of the global supply. China is the world’s largest exporter of grains and is by far the world’s leading agricultural producer with 2020 annual output valued at $1.56 trillion1. China also has one of the world’s largest pool of agricultural labour, farm work accounts for more than 25% of national employment in 2019. India had the second highest agricultural output at $403.5 billion in 2020, and of that, $382.2 billion was attributable to food production.

Our model focuses on modelling the supply of food produced by China and India  

By 2050, the world population will reach 9.1 billion. It is estimated that food production levels need to increase by 70 percent in order to meet this increase in population. To reach those levels of food production, countries can either increase production or net imports of food, or a combination of both.  

This analysis therefore aims to predict the amount of crop yield in China and India based on the annual temperature, amount of arable land, GDP per capita, volume of fertilizers used over a certain time period in order to better understand supply of crops.
